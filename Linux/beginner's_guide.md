## 3. Getting Started with Linux

### a. Choosing a Linux Distribution
A Linux "distribution" (or distro) is a version of Linux tailored for different needs. Hereâ€™s a guide:  
- **For Beginners**: Ubuntu or Linux Mint.  
- **For Cybersecurity**: Kali Linux or Parrot OS.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Example**:  
Download Ubuntu from [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download) or Kali Linux from [kali.org](https://www.kali.org/).

### b. Setting Up Linux
- **Option 1: Install on Your Computer**  
  - Dual boot with Windows.  
- **Option 2: Virtual Machine**  
  - Use VirtualBox or VMware to run Linux without altering your current OS.

## 4. Linux Basics for Beginners

### a. Linux Terminal
The terminal is the command-line interface (CLI) where you interact with Linux.

**Why the terminal?**  
Itâ€™s powerful, faster than GUIs, and a must for cybersecurity tasks.  

### b. Basic Commands

| **Command**       | **Purpose**                | **Example**                |
|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `ls`              | List files in a directory  | `ls /home`                |
| `cd`              | Change directory           | `cd Documents`            |
| `pwd`             | Print current directory    | `pwd`                     |
| `mkdir`           | Create a folder            | `mkdir projects`          |
| `rm`              | Delete files or folders    | `rm file.txt`             |
| `cp`              | Copy files or folders      | `cp file.txt /backup/`    |
| `chmod`           | Change file permissions    | `chmod 700 script.sh`     |

ðŸ‘‰ **Example**:  
Create a folder for cybersecurity practice:  
```bash
mkdir CyberPractice
cd CyberPractice
```

### c. Understanding File System
- Linux has a hierarchical file system:  
  - `/`: Root directory.  
  - `/home`: User directories.  
  - `/var`: Logs and variable data.  
  - `/etc`: Configuration files.  

---

## 5. Managing Users and Permissions

### a. User Roles in Linux
- **Root**: Admin with full access.  
- **Regular User**: Limited permissions for security.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Example**: Switch to the root user:  
```bash
sudo su
```

### b. File Permissions
Linux uses a permission system:  
- **r**: Read  
- **w**: Write  
- **x**: Execute  

**Example**:  
Change permissions of a script:  
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

## 6. Networking Commands for Cybersecurity

| **Command**        | **Purpose**                  | **Example**                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `ifconfig`         | Show network configuration   | `ifconfig`                  |
| `ping`             | Test connectivity            | `ping google.com`           |
| `netstat`          | Display network connections  | `netstat -a`                |
| `traceroute`       | Trace route to a host        | `traceroute google.com`     |

ðŸ‘‰ **Example**: Test if a website is reachable:  
```bash
ping -c 4 example.com
```

---

## 7. Linux Tools for Cybersecurity

### a. Nmap
**Purpose**: Network scanning and vulnerability assessment.  
**Command**:  
```bash
nmap -sV target_ip
```

### b. Wireshark
**Purpose**: Packet analysis for detecting anomalies.  
- Run it on Linux to analyze live network traffic.

### c. Metasploit Framework
**Purpose**: Penetration testing framework.  
**Command**:  
```bash
msfconsole
```

---

## 8. Linux Automation with Shell Scripting

### a. What is Shell Scripting?
Automating repetitive tasks using Linux commands in a script.

### b. Simple Script Example:
Create a script to check disk space:  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
df -h > disk_usage.txt
echo "Disk usage saved to disk_usage.txt"
```

Run the script:  
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

## 9. Securing Linux for Cybersecurity

### a. Update Regularly
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### b. Enable Firewalls
- Use `ufw`:  
```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

### c. Monitor Logs
Check logs for anomalies:  
```bash
cat /var/log/auth.log
```
