# Part 2: Types of Cyber Attacks

Cyber attacks are deliberate attempts by attackers to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. To help secure digital environments, it's crucial to understand the different types of cyber attacks, how they work, and how they affect individuals and organizations.

## 1. Malware Attacks

Malware, short for "malicious software," is software designed to damage or exploit any device it infects. Malware includes various harmful programs like **viruses**, **ransomware**, **spyware**, and **trojans**.

- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that attach themselves to legitimate files or software and spread to other devices. Viruses can corrupt data, disrupt performance, or spread harmful payloads.
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files on a device, rendering them inaccessible until the victim pays a ransom. Failure to pay often results in permanent data loss.
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors user activity, collecting sensitive data like passwords, credit card details, or browsing history.
- **Trojans**: Malware disguised as legitimate software. Once installed, it allows attackers to take control of the infected system.

### Real-World Example: WannaCry Ransomware Attack
In 2017, the **WannaCry ransomware** attack affected over 200,000 computers worldwide. Attackers used a known vulnerability in Windows to spread ransomware across various organizations, including hospitals, banks, and telecommunications companies. Once infected, files on these systems were locked with strong encryption, and attackers demanded ransom payments to restore access. This attack highlighted the importance of software updates and backups for cybersecurity.

## 2. Phishing Attacks

Phishing attacks deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal details. Phishing often appears in the form of fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that mimic legitimate institutions.

### Types of Phishing
- **Email Phishing**: Attackers send mass emails that appear to be from trusted organizations, like banks or social media sites, prompting users to click malicious links.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing attempts aimed at specific individuals, often using personal information to make the message seem legitimate.
- **Smishing and Vishing**: Phishing conducted via SMS (smishing) or phone calls (vishing), where attackers impersonate trusted contacts.

### Real-World Example: Google Docs Phishing Scam
In 2017, a phishing scam targeted Google users with fake Google Docs links. When recipients clicked on the link, it redirected them to a fake Google login page, prompting them to enter their credentials. Once entered, attackers gained unauthorized access to users’ Google accounts, demonstrating the ease with which phishing can compromise personal security.

## 3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

A **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack involves overwhelming a server, network, or website with excessive traffic to make it inaccessible to legitimate users. Attackers use large numbers of devices, often compromised computers or IoT devices, to flood the target with data requests, causing it to crash or slow down significantly.

### Real-World Example: Dyn DDoS Attack
In 2016, a massive DDoS attack targeted Dyn, a major DNS provider. This attack disrupted internet service for numerous popular sites, including Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit. Attackers used a botnet of IoT devices infected with malware to launch the attack, showcasing the vulnerability of unsecured IoT devices in the growing network landscape.

## 4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

In a **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attack, an attacker secretly intercepts and alters the communication between two parties. By eavesdropping, attackers can steal sensitive data, such as login credentials or financial information.

### Common Types of MitM Attacks
- **Eavesdropping**: Intercepting communications over unsecured networks, like public Wi-Fi, to gain access to transmitted data.
- **Session Hijacking**: Taking over an active session between a client and server by stealing session cookies, giving attackers access to sensitive user data.

### Real-World Example: Public Wi-Fi Eavesdropping
Imagine logging into your bank account over public Wi-Fi in a coffee shop. An attacker on the same network could intercept the data exchange if it isn’t properly encrypted. This allows them to steal your login credentials or financial information, compromising your privacy and security.

---

## 5. SQL Injection Attacks

An **SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection** attack exploits vulnerabilities in a website’s database layer. Attackers inject malicious SQL code into a query, allowing them to manipulate or retrieve data directly from the database.

### Real-World Example: SQL Injection on a Retail Website
In 2019, an e-commerce website suffered a data breach because of an SQL injection vulnerability. Attackers manipulated the login page’s SQL queries, gaining unauthorized access to the user database. They retrieved sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and payment details, causing significant financial and reputational damage to the business.

---

## 6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks

In a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack, attackers inject malicious scripts into a website, which then executes on users’ browsers. XSS attacks allow attackers to steal session cookies, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

### Real-World Example: XSS on a Forum Page
On a forum site, a user might post a comment containing a JavaScript snippet. If the site doesn’t sanitize inputs, other users who view the comment would unknowingly run the script in their browsers. This could lead to stolen session cookies or redirected users, posing significant privacy and security risks.

## 7. Brute Force and Password Attacks

Brute force attacks attempt to guess passwords through repeated trial and error. Attackers use automated tools to try thousands, or even millions, of password combinations until they find the correct one.

### Common Types of Password Attacks
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Attackers use a list of common passwords or words (like names and dates) to guess a user’s password.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Attackers use stolen credentials from a previous breach to try logging in to other sites, relying on the fact that many users reuse passwords.

### Real-World Example: Credential Stuffing on Netflix Accounts
Netflix accounts are common targets for credential stuffing. Attackers use previously leaked usernames and passwords to try logging into Netflix accounts, assuming many people reuse credentials across multiple platforms. This highlights the importance of unique passwords for each online account.

---

## 8. Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering attacks rely on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits. Attackers use trust or fear tactics to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.

### Real-World Example: Tech Support Scams
In a tech support scam, attackers call users pretending to be from a well-known company, like Microsoft, and claim that the user’s computer is infected with malware. They convince the user to download remote access software, allowing attackers to take control of the device and install actual malware, showing the real dangers of social engineering.

---

## 9. Insider Threats

Insider threats arise from people within an organization—employees, contractors, or business partners—who misuse their access to company data. Insiders may act maliciously or accidentally, but either way, their actions can lead to data breaches or system compromises.

### Real-World Example: Edward Snowden’s Disclosure
In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the NSA, leaked classified information to the public, exposing details about global surveillance programs. This incident showed how insider threats can cause significant reputational and operational harm, especially when trusted individuals have access to sensitive information.

---

## 10. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are highly sophisticated, targeted attacks where attackers infiltrate a network and remain undetected for extended periods. APTs are often state-sponsored and are used for espionage or to steal sensitive data over time.

### Real-World Example: Stuxnet Worm
The **Stuxnet worm**, allegedly developed by the U.S. and Israeli governments, targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities. Stuxnet covertly disrupted the control systems used in uranium enrichment, damaging equipment and delaying the nuclear program. This example highlights the complexity and potential consequences of APTs in geopolitics and national security.
